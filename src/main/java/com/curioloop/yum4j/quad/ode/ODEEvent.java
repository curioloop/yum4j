/**
 * Defines an event to be detected during ODE integration.
 *
 * <p>An event is a zero crossing of a scalar indicator function {@code g(t, y)}.
 * The solver monitors sign changes of {@code g} after each step and uses Brent's method
 * to locate the exact crossing time within the step interval.</p>

 * ODEEvent landing = new ODEEvent(
 *     (t, y) -> y[0],           // g(t, y) = y[0]
 *     ODEEvent.Trigger.FALLING,  // triggered when g goes positive → negative
 *     1                          // terminal: stop after 1 occurrence
